        <p> So far in this class we have learned things about computers from hardware all the way to programing! I first learned about the hardware in our basic computers, then I learned about how both python and c work! I learned a tiny bit about sequnce and now I'm currently learning about how HTML works. Some things that I liked the most about this class were The financial calculator, The programing Final, the sequence island lesson, and almost all of the assingments in the programing unit. </p>
