        <h2>About dogs</h2>
        <p>I really like dogs, and they like me. The type of dogs I like are generally the bigger and more playfull ones because of how great they are for suggleing. Dogs are amazing and there are somany different breeds. I sadly am alergic to dogs but that sad flaw doesn't stop me from having to great dogs of my own that I play with everyday. I have a multi-poodle breed for one and the other one was suppolsed to be a teacup puppy but its actually a different breed. despite both of their flaws I love both of my dogs so much. C:</p>
